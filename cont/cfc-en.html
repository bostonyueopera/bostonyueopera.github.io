<i>We are proud to participate in Mass Cultural Council&#39;s Card to Culture program in collaboration with the Department of Transitional Assistance, the Department of Public Health&#39;s WIC Nutrition Program, the Massachusetts Health Connector, and hundreds of cultural organizations across Massachusetts by making cultural programming accessible to those for whom cost is a participation barrier.
